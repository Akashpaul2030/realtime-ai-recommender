## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If Redis isn't running:
```bash
docker run -p 6379:6379 -d redislabs/redismod
```

### If API won't start:
```bash
# Check virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### If Streamlit has issues:
```bash
pip install streamlit plotly
streamlit run streamlit_api_tester.py --server.port 8502
```
